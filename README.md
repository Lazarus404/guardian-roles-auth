# GuardianRolesAuth

This is available for my own personal benefit.  It adds roles capabilities to Guardian, but I needed to put it into a separate library so I could use it in multiple services without duplicating code.

If anyone wants me to develop on this to make it a useful public tool, let me know :-)
